\arguments{
\item{data_input}{An n x d data frame or matrix of the summary statistics z score, n is the nubmer of genes, d is the number of data types. Each row is a gene, each column is a data type.}

\item{mu_ini}{Initial value for the mean of the independent mixture model distribution. A vector of length 2*d, d is number of data types. Needs to be in a special format that corresponds to the initial value of mu, for example, if d=3, needs to be in the format of (null_1,alternative_1,null_2,alternative_2,null_3,alternative_3).}

\item{cov_ini}{A list of initial values for the covariance matrices. If there are three data types and 8 components, then the initial is a list of 8 covariance matrices, each matix is 3*3.}

\item{p_ini}{Initial value for the proportion of the distribution in the Gaussian mixture model. A vector of length 2^d, d is the number of data types.}

\item{tol}{The convergence criterion. Convergence is declared when the change in the observed data log-likelihood increases by less than epsilon.}

\item{maxiter}{The maximum number of iteration, default is 1000}

\item{seed}{Set.seed, default is 10}

\item{ini.ind}{Use the parameters estimated from IMIX-ind for initial values of other IMIX models, default is TRUE}

\item{model}{Which model to use to compute the data, default is all}

\item{model_selection_method}{Model selection information criteria, based on AIC or BIC, default is AIC}

\item{alpha}{Prespecified nominal level for global FDR control, default is 0.2}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print the full log-likelihood for each iteration, default is FALSE}
