}
\arguments{
\item{data_input}{An n x d data frame or matrix of the summary statistics z score, n is the nubmer of genes, d is the number of data types. Each row is a gene, each column is a data type.}

\item{g}{The number of components, default is 8 for three data types}

\item{mu_vec}{Input of the mean value output from IMIX-Ind result, a list of the mean vectors for each component.}

\item{cov}{A list of initial values for the covariance matrices. If there are three data types and 8 components, then the initial is a list of 8 covariance matrices, each matix is 3*3.}

\item{p}{Initial value for the proportion of the distribution in the Gaussian mixture model}

\item{tol}{The convergence criterion. Convergence is declared when the change in the observed data log-likelihood increases by less than epsilon.}

\item{maxiter}{The maximum number of iteration, default is 1000}

\item{seed}{set.seed, default is 10}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print the full log-likelihood for each iteration, default is FALSE}
}

\description{
Fitting a correlated multivariate mixture model with fixed mean from estimated parameters of IMIX-ind. Input of summary statistics z scores of two or three data types.
